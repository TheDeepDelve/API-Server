## Setup and Running the Project

### 1. API Server Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubUsername]/[YourRepoName].git
    cd [YourRepoName]/api-server
    ```
2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    The `server.js` file is already configured with metrics.

### 2. Prometheus Setup

1.  **Extract Prometheus:** Create a directory (e.g., `D:\DevOps_Tools\Prometheus`) and extract the Prometheus `.zip` contents there.
2.  **Configuration Files:** The necessary `prometheus.yml` and `alert.rules.yml` are already included in the `api-server` directory of this repository. You will point Prometheus to use these.

### 3. Alertmanager Setup

1.  **Extract Alertmanager:** Create a directory (e.g., `D:\DevOps_Tools\Alertmanager`) and extract the Alertmanager `.zip` contents there.
2.  **Configuration File:** The `alertmanager.yml` file is included in the `api-server` directory.

### 4. Grafana Setup

1.  **Install Grafana:** Run the Grafana `.msi` installer. It will typically install as a Windows service.
2.  **Initial Login & Password Reset (if needed):**
    *   Access Grafana at `http://localhost:3000`.
    *   Default credentials are `admin`/`admin`. You'll be prompted to change the password.
    *   If you forget your password, stop Grafana, open an administrative terminal, navigate to `C:\Program Files\GrafanaLabs\grafana\bin` (or your install path) and run:
        ```powershell
        .\grafana-cli.exe admin reset-admin-password YourNewStrongPassword
        ```
    *   Restart Grafana.
3.  **Add Prometheus Data Source:**
    *   In Grafana: Configuration (gear icon) -> Data Sources -> Add data source -> Prometheus.
    *   **Name:** `Prometheus` (or similar)
    *   **URL:** `http://localhost:9090`
    *   Click "Save & test". You should see a success message.

### Running the Full Stack

You will need to run each component in a separate terminal window.

1.  **Start the Node.js API Server:**
    *   Open a terminal, navigate to the `api-server` directory.
    *   Run: `node server.js`
    *   *Expected Output:* Server listening on `http://localhost:5000`, metrics on `http://localhost:5000/metrics`.

2.  **Start Prometheus:**
    *   Open a *new* terminal.
    *   Run Prometheus, pointing to the configuration file in your `api-server` project directory:
        ```bash
        # Adjust D:\DevOps_Tools\Prometheus to your Prometheus executable path
        # Adjust D:\path\to\your\project\api-server to your project path
        D:\DevOps_Tools\Prometheus\prometheus.exe --config.file="D:\path\to\your\project\api-server\prometheus.yml" --storage.tsdb.path="D:\path\to\your\project\api-server\data\prometheus"
        ```
        *   **Note:** The `--storage.tsdb.path` flag is crucial if `prometheus.yml` is not in the same directory as `prometheus.exe`, to ensure data is stored within your project structure (and can be gitignored). If `prometheus.yml` (and thus the `data` folder) is in the same directory where you run `prometheus.exe`, this flag might not be strictly necessary as it defaults to `./data`. For clarity and consistency when configs are separate, it's good to specify. Ensure the `api-server/data/prometheus` path exists or Prometheus can create it.

3.  **Start Alertmanager:**
    *   Open a *new* terminal.
    *   Run Alertmanager, pointing to its configuration file:
        ```bash
        # Adjust D:\DevOps_Tools\Alertmanager to your Alertmanager executable path
        D:\DevOps_Tools\Alertmanager\alertmanager.exe --config.file="D:\path\to\your\project\api-server\alertmanager.yml" --storage.path="D:\path\to\your\project\api-server\data\alertmanager"
        ```
        *   **Note:** Similarly, use `--storage.path` for Alertmanager data.

4.  **Ensure Grafana is Running:**
    *   If installed as a service, it should be running. Check `Services.msc`.
    *   If run manually, ensure `grafana-server.exe` is executing.

## Accessing the Services

*   **API Server:** `http://localhost:5000`
*   **API Metrics:** `http://localhost:5000/metrics`
*   **Prometheus UI:** `http://localhost:9090`
*   **Alertmanager UI:** `http://localhost:9093`
*   **Grafana UI:** `http://localhost:3000`

---

## Generating Traffic & Triggering Alerts

Use the `generate_electronics_traffic.sh` script (provided in this repository, or adapt it) in Git Bash to send varied requests to the API.

1.  **Ensure the script is executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x generate_electronics_traffic.sh
    ```
2.  **Run the script from the `api-server` directory (or wherever you placed it):**
    ```bash
    ./generate_electronics_traffic.sh
    ```

This script is designed to hit various endpoints, including `/intentional-error`, which should trigger the `HighApiErrorRate` alert after sustained 5xx errors (as defined by `for: 1m` in `alert.rules.yml`). Observe your Grafana dashboards and Prometheus/Alertmanager UIs while the script is running. Press `Ctrl+C` in the Git Bash window to stop the script.

**Alert Firing Example:**

The `HighApiErrorRate` alert is configured in `alert.rules.yml` and managed by Alertmanager. It is designed to fire if more than 5% of requests to the API result in a 5xx (server-side) error over a 2-minute period, for a sustained duration of at least 1 minute. This can be tested by repeatedly hitting the `/intentional-error` endpoint.
*The `HighApiErrorRate` alert shown as 'FIRING' in the Prometheus or Alertmanager UI after intentionally triggering server errors.*

## Key Metrics Exposed

The `server.js` in this project exposes several key metrics for monitoring:

*   **`http_requests_total`**: A counter for the total number of HTTP requests, labeled by:
    *   `method` (e.g., GET, POST)
    *   `route` (e.g., /products, /cart)
    *   `code` (e.g., 200, 404, 500)
*   **`http_request_duration_seconds`**: A histogram measuring the latency of HTTP requests, also labeled by `method`, `route`, and `code`.
*   **`electronics_product_detail_views_total`**: A counter for views of specific product detail pages, labeled by `productId`, `category`, and `brand`.
*   **`electronics_items_added_to_cart_total`**: A counter for items added to the shopping cart, labeled by `productId` and `category`.
*   **`electronics_orders_placed_total`**: A counter for successfully placed orders.
*   **`electronics_inventory_level`**: A gauge representing the current stock level for products, labeled by `productId`, `category`, and `brand`.

## Example Dashboards & Alerts

### 1. HTTP Request Rate (Requests per minute)
Displays the per-minute average rate of incoming requests, broken down by API route and HTTP method. Helps identify the busiest endpoints, detect traffic surges or drops, and understand usage patterns.

![HTTP Request Rate](Images/http_request_rate.png)


### 2. P95 Request Latency by Route
Shows the 95th percentile latency (the time within which 95% of requests completed) for each route. Crucial for understanding worst-case performance experienced by users and identifying slow endpoints needing optimization. Unit set to seconds.

![P95 Request Latency](Images/p95_latency.png)


### 3. Server Error Rate (5xx) by Route
Tracks the rate of server-side errors (HTTP status codes 500-599) per route. Essential for quickly detecting backend problems affecting specific API functionalities.

![Server Error Rate](Images/server_error_rate.png)


### 4. Total Requests (Last Hour)
Provides a single statistic showing the total number of requests received over the selected period (e.g., last hour). Useful for a high-level overview of application load.

![Total Requests](Images/total_requests.png)


### 5. Top 5 Routes (Last Hour)
Identifies the most frequently requested API routes over the selected period. Helps focus optimization efforts and understand which parts of the API are most used.

![Top 5 Routes](Images/top_5_routes.png)


### 6. Request Status Codes (Last Hour)
Visualizes the distribution of HTTP status codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx) across all requests. Provides a quick health check – a large slice of 5xx or 4xx codes indicates widespread issues.

## Future Enhancements

This project serves as a strong foundation. Potential future enhancements include:

*   **Dockerization:** Containerize all services (API server, Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager) using Docker and Docker Compose for improved portability, consistency, and ease of deployment.
*   **Persistent Storage:** Configure robust persistent storage for Prometheus time-series data and Grafana configurations (dashboards, users, data sources), especially when moving towards a production-like environment.
*   **Advanced Alerting & Notifications:**
    *   Implement more sophisticated alert rules (e.g., low inventory alerts, high cart abandonment rate, specific business KPI thresholds).
    *   Configure Alertmanager to route alerts to actual notification channels (e.g., Email, Slack, PagerDuty).
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrate the project with a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) for automated building, testing, and potentially deployment of the API server and monitoring configurations.
*   **API Security:** Implement authentication (e.g., JWT) and authorization mechanisms for the API endpoints.
*   **Database Integration:** Replace the in-memory data storage with a persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for the API server.
*   **Distributed Tracing:** If the API were to evolve into microservices, integrating distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) would be a valuable addition for end-to-end request visibility.
*   **Log Management:** Complement metrics with a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK Stack, Loki).
